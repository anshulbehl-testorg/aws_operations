We welcome contributions to the `aws.aws_operations.run` Ansible role! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions are highly appreciated. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the main repository.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone your fork to your local machine:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aws_operations.git
cd aws_operations
\`\`\`

### 3. Set Up the Environment

Ensure you have Ansible installed and set up. You may also need to install any required collections:

\`\`\`bash
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
\`\`\`

### 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that summarizes your changes:

\`\`\`bash
git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-feature
\`\`\`

## Making Changes

### 1. Follow Coding Standards

- **Code Style**: Follow the Ansible best practices for writing roles and playbooks. Ensure your code is well-organized, properly indented, and commented where necessary.
- **Variables**: Use descriptive variable names and avoid hardcoding values. Instead, use variables that can be overridden by the user.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure that your tasks are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended changes.

### 2. Test Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, make sure to test them thoroughly:

- **Unit Testing**: If applicable, write and run unit tests for your changes.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the role in a real AWS environment to ensure it behaves as expected.

### 3. Document Your Changes

Update the documentation to reflect any new features or changes you’ve made:

- **Role Documentation**: If you’ve added new variables, tasks, or functionality, update the relevant Markdown files (e.g., `index.md`, `setup.md`).
- **Changelog**: Add an entry to the `changelog.md` file summarizing your changes.

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

\`\`\`bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"
\`\`\`

### 2. Push Your Changes

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

\`\`\`bash
git push origin feature/new-awesome-feature
\`\`\`

### 3. Open a Pull Request

Navigate to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request. Provide a clear and descriptive title and include any relevant information about the changes you’ve made.

### 4. Review Process

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to make any necessary revisions based on feedback. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues while using the role, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, relevant error messages, and any potential solutions you’ve identified.
